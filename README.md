Doom source port in Lisp

## Why

In the last few years I've been watching Doom videos a lot,
particularly [Decino's](https://www.youtube.com/@decino), and I've
resumed playing occasionally, marveling at modern maps such as Ancient
Aliens and Auger; Zenith. I suck, but I have fun playing. I love programming and I love Lisp, but haven't done much Lisp lately. So I'd like to 1. write some Lisp 2. understand Doom (and games) better, from a programmer's point of view.
